## Concept:

## Technologies Used:

## Approach:

#### Overview
I started asking my little 11 years old dauhghter about a game, she suggesting creating a game for my little 2 years old where she can find hidden objects. At that time she was watching the Ice Age movie and inmediately I began my pseudocoding. I put all my ideas together and gather some advises from my instructors.

#### User stories

As I user, specially a child, will expect to see animations and diffents elements to change colors and positions

#### Development Plan 



*  My Development Plan ONE was to create and finish my html and css layout and make sure that all my elements were in the right position and with the desire colors
* My Development Plan Two was to transform my pseudo code into a real and functional JavaScript/JQuery code, and I believe I did.

#### MVP

* MVP ONE
* MVP Two
* MVP Three 
* MVP Four

#### Stretch goals

* My Stretch goals ONE is to try to make my divs to randomly shuffle everytime you press the start game button, I know that Arthur told that will be difficult but possible, so I will do it.
 
## Challenges:

Well, I faced a road block trying to make the images to randomly shuffle inside my divs. It took me a lot of hours and a lot of research, but finally one night after 5 1/2 hours I did it (I was up until 1:45am)
